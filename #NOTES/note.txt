Hmm okay I think I get it. It definitely cuts off but it still passes through the bottom border 
of the box.

It sounds like you've successfully conquered the infinite loop and the function "hand-over"—that's 
a huge "genius" moment right there!

The reason it’s still "peeking" over the border is likely down to a tiny detail in how Phaser 
calculates height versus how you defined your rectangle.

Why it’s still passing the border
The "Last Line" Gap: If your chatBox.height is 130px, and your text height is 125px, the while 
loop says "Everything is fine!" and stops. 
But then you might have padding or line spacing 
that pushes that last line just a few pixels over the green line.
The Starting Y-Position: Your chatBox starts at y: 140. Your chatLogText starts at y: 150. 
That’s a 10-pixel "cushion" at the top. If the text grows to 130px tall 
(the full height of the box), it will end at y: 280, which is 10 pixels past the bottom of 
your box!

How to tighten it up
You can fix this with a little "Safety Math" inside your while loop condition:
The Math Fix: Instead of checking display.height > box.height, try checking if the bottom of 
the text is past the bottom of the box.
Pseudo-code: WHILE ( (text.y + text.height) > (box.y + box.height) )
The "Padding" Hack: Or, just subtract a small buffer from your limit: WHILE 
(display.height > (box.height - 15))
The Professional "Polish" (Geometry Masks)
If you want the text to never be seen outside that green box (even for a split second), you 
should look into Phaser 3 Geometry Masks.
Essentially, you tell the game: "Only draw this text if it is inside this specific rectangle."
Create a Graphics object the same size as your box.
Use chatLogText.setMask(yourGraphicsObject.createGeometryMask()).
This is how pro chatboxes handle "scrolling" or "overflow" so that letters don't awkwardly hang 
over the UI borders.
Which feels more "correct" for your brain right now: adjusting the math in the loop, or trying 
out a Mask to hide the overflow?
