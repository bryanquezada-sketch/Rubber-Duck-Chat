That is the spirit! Here is a classic "Cooldown" scenario that uses the exact same logic principles you just learned.
The Scenario: The Magic Wand
You are building a game where a player clicks a Wand to cast a spell.
When clicked, the Wand spawns a Sparkle (an image).
The Sparkle must stay on screen for 2 seconds and then be destroyed.
The Rule: The player cannot cast a new Sparkle if one is already on the screen.
The Challenge
I have provided the "broken" version of the code below. It has the Scope and Logic errors we discussed.
How would you rewrite this to make it work? (You can just explain the steps or write the snippet).
javascript
// BROKEN CODE 
create() {
  const wand = this.add.sprite(100, 100, 'wand').setInteractive();

  wand.on('pointerdown', () => {
    // ERROR: This will crash on the first click because sparkle is unknown
    // ERROR: This variable is scoped to this function and "dies" after the click
    if (sparkle.active) { 
      return; // Stop the function if sparkle exists
    }

    const sparkle = this.add.image(200, 200, 'sparkle');

    this.time.delayedCall(2000, () => {
      sparkle.destroy();
    });
  });
}
Use code with caution.

Think about:
Where does the sparkle variable need to be declared so it doesn't "die"?
What should you do inside the delayedCall to "unlock" the wand for the next click?
How would you fix it?
