Mammalian Predators
Mammals often hunt at night and are a primary concern for nesting or roosting adult ducks. 
Foxes: Common and persistent hunters known to prey heavily on adult ducks.
Coyotes and Bobcats: Larger canines and felines that can easily take down adult ducks and can jump over fences to access them.
Raccoons: While also targeting eggs and ducklings, a hungry raccoon will take an adult duck if the opportunity arises, especially if it can reach them through fencing.
Minks and Weasels: Agile predators that, while small, are very effective hunters capable of killing adult birds.
Domestic Dogs: Stray or unleashed dogs are a significant and often overlooked threat to adult ducks. 
Avian Predators
Large birds of prey are a major daytime threat, using their height and speed to attack from the air. 
Hawks: Larger species of hawks frequently prey on adult ducks.
Eagles: Capable of grabbing adult ducks "without a trace" and carrying them off.
Owls: As nocturnal hunters, owls can prey on adult ducks during the night. 
Aquatic Predators
Adult ducks are not entirely safe in the water either. 
Snapping Turtles: Large snapping turtles have powerful jaws and are known to take both ducklings and full-grown ducks underwater.
Large Fish: Predatory fish such as pike and muskies have been known to include adult ducks in their diet. 


Yes, snapping turtles and those predatory fish are specifically freshwater predators. They are commonly found in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. 
Regarding their diet, ducks are opportunistic omnivores, meaning they eat a wide variety of both plant and animal matter depending on what is available. 
A Duck's Primary Diet
While it varies by season and environment, a natural wild duck diet typically includes: 
Aquatic Plants: Pondweed, duckweed, water lilies, algae, and various aquatic grasses are core staples.
Invertebrates: This is a crucial protein source, especially during breeding season. They eat insects (beetles, flies, dragonflies), larvae, snails, worms, and small crustaceans like crayfish or shrimp.
Seeds and Grains: In the fall and winter, ducks rely heavily on energy-dense seeds from wetland plants, acorns, and leftover agricultural crops like corn, rice, and wheat.
Small Aquatic Animals: While not the main meal for most, many ducks will eat small minnows, fish eggs, and even tiny frogs or tadpoles. 
Freshwater Predator Dynamics
Snapping Turtles: These are often considered "underwater killers" for waterfowl. They are ambush predators that live in muddy-bottomed freshwater habitats and can snatch both ducklings and adult ducks from below.
Predatory Fish: Species like Northern Pike and Muskies are apex freshwater predators. Because they are "gape-limited" (they eat what fits in their mouth), they view anything on the surface—including ducks—as potential prey.


Whether a duck swims underwater or stays near the shore depends entirely on which of the two main "groups" it belongs to: Dabblers or Divers. 
1. Dabbling Ducks (The "Butt-Up" Group) 
Dabblers, like the common Mallard, Pintail, and Teal, rarely dive completely underwater. Instead, they focus on aquatic plants and insects found in shallow water (usually less than 18 inches deep). 
How they feed: They tip forward until their "butts" are in the air and their heads are submerged to reach plants on the bottom.
Location: They stick to the shoreline, shallow marshes, and flooded fields where they can graze on aquatic grass, seeds, and small invertebrates. 
2. Diving Ducks (The "Deep-Sea" Group)
Diving ducks, such as Scaup, Canvasbacks, and Mergansers, are built to swim fully underwater to find food in deeper water. 
How they feed: They plunge completely under the surface, using their large, rear-set webbed feet—and sometimes their wings—to propel themselves downward.
How deep they go: Most stay between 6 to 15 feet, but some are extraordinary athletes. The Long-tailed Duck and the Eider have been recorded diving as deep as 180 to 200 feet to find mollusks and fish.
Location: You’ll find them in large, open bodies of water like lakes, reservoirs, and even the open ocean. 
Which is Which?
Feature 	Dabbling Ducks (e.g., Mallard)	Diving Ducks (e.g., Scaup)
Feeding Style	Tipping "butt-up" in shallows	Swimming fully underwater
Feet Position	Centered (good for walking)	Back of body (propellers for diving)
Takeoff	Jump straight out of the water	Must "run" across the water surface
